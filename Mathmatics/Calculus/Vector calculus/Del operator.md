# Del operator

Del, $\nabla$ is a vector differential operator and used in especially [[Vector calculus]]
In the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] $\mathbf{R}^n$ with coordinates $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, del is defined as

$$
\nabla = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}).
$$

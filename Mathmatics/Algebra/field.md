# field(体[たい])

A field is a set that addition and multiplication are defined on it, e.g., the field of real numbers notated by $\mathbb{R}$, the field of complex numbers as $\mathbb{C}$.

## Definition

If and only if $K$ satisfies the following requirements, it can be called field.

$a, b, c \in K$
1. $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$
2. $\exists! a \in K, a + 0 = 0 + a = a$
3. $a + b = b + a$
4. $a + b = b + a = 0, \forall a \in K \implies b = 0$.
5. $a(bc) = (ab)c$
5. $ab = ba$
6. $\exists! a \in K, a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$
7. $a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0$
8. If $ab = ba = 0$, $\forall a \in K$, then $b = 0$

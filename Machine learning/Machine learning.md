# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a general term of theories and techniques to predict or make a decision for unknown phenomena extracting structures or characters from observed data.
The theory consists of [[Mathematics]] especially in [[Statistics]] and [[Probability theory]].
Then, it is calculated by computer algorithms.

# Bayesian inference

Bayesian inference is a statistical inference method.
We assume a hypothesis for a target phenomenon and update the hypothesis for observations using [[Bayes theorem]].

## Procedure

1. Build [[Probabilistic model]] for a phenomenon that you would like to predict or explain.
1. Substitute all parameters or variables except for variables we want to know, then we get an inference for the phenomenon.

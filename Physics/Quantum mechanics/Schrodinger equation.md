# Schr√∂dinger equation

Consider a particle moves so slowly that we don't need to think of the effects of relativity.
We can describe the particle behavior by the solution of the following equation as

$$
\left\{  - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}, t) \right\} \Psi (\mathbf{r}, t)
= \mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi (\mathbf{r}, t).
$$

- $m$: mass
- $\mathbf{r}$: particle's coordinate
- $t$: time
- $\hbar$: [[Planck constant]]
- $\nabla$: [[Laplace operator]]
- $V(\mathbf{r}, t)$: [[Potential]] 
- $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$: wave function

$$
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}, t) = - \mathrm{grad} V(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

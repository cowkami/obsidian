	- basic:
		- self defence: in case you are choked with the oppent's both arms, step back and bow with guard from his knee kick. if you failed to escape, grab his both arms then cut the grip to over head.
		- [[cross choke 1]] (both palm up)
		- [[cross choke 1]] from closed guard: grab his same side collor shallow and push(not pull), grab other side collor deeply. push both arm to adujust your wrist angle.
		- scissor sweep: when you grab his collor with your one arm but he did defence for the other side. unlock your closed guard, check his stomach with your shin deeply and check his knee with your calf, get up your upper body, move his base to your shin, and slice your legs like a scissor.
